# Sample Lesson Plan: AR Urban Garden for Grade 5-6

## Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes  
**Grade Level**: Grade 5-6 (Ages 10-12)  
**Subject**: Science / Environmental Education  
**Technology**: Android AR app, tablets/phones

## Learning Objectives

1. Students will identify common urban plants using AR technology
2. Students will understand basic plant care needs (water, sunlight)
3. Students will use AR to visualize garden layouts
4. Students will record and track plant growth over time

## Materials Needed

- Android tablets/phones (ARCore compatible) - 1 per student or pair
- AR Urban Garden app installed
- Sample plants (basil, mint, tomato, etc.) or plant images
- Optional: BLE soil sensors (1-2 for demonstration)
- Worksheet (optional)

## Lesson Structure

### Part 1: Introduction (5 minutes)

**Activity**:
1. Teacher introduces the app: "Today we'll learn about plants using AR!"
2. Show app icon and main menu
3. Brief explanation: "This app uses your camera to see plants and give you information"

**Key Points**:
- AR = Augmented Reality (overlays information on real world)
- We'll use the camera to identify plants
- Everything is safe and fun!

### Part 2: Onboarding (5 minutes)

**Activity**:
1. Students open app for first time
2. Complete onboarding flow:
   - Welcome screen
   - Camera permission
   - Privacy explanation
3. Teacher assists students who need help

**Checkpoint**: All students complete onboarding

### Part 3: Plant Identification (5 minutes)

**Activity**:
1. Teacher: "Let's identify a plant!"
2. Students select "Identify Plant" from main menu
3. Point camera at plant (or plant image)
4. App recognizes plant and shows information
5. Teacher discusses:
   - Plant name (English and Tagalog)
   - Water needs
   - Sunlight needs

**Sample Questions**:
- "What plant did you find?"
- "How often does it need water?"
- "Does it need a lot of sun?"

### Part 4: AR Placement (5 minutes)

**Activity**:
1. Teacher: "Let's plan where to put our garden!"
2. Students select "Place Garden"
3. Find flat surface (desk, floor)
4. Place virtual pots using AR
5. App shows spacing recommendations
6. Students experiment with different layouts

**Learning**: Understanding spacing and layout for gardens

### Part 5: Growth Tracking (5 minutes)

**Activity**:
1. Teacher: "Let's record our plant's growth!"
2. Students select "Track Growth"
3. Take photo of plant (or use provided image)
4. App saves photo with timestamp
5. Teacher explains: "We'll take photos over time to see how plants grow"

**Extension**: Show timeline view if multiple photos exist

### Part 6: Wrap-up and Discussion (5 minutes)

**Questions for Discussion**:
1. "What did you learn about plants today?"
2. "Which feature did you like most?"
3. "How can AR help us learn about gardening?"

**Key Takeaways**:
- Plants have different needs (water, sunlight)
- Technology can help us learn about nature
- We can track growth over time

## Assessment

### Formative Assessment (During Lesson)
- Observe students using the app
- Check if they can complete tasks
- Note any confusion or difficulties

### Simple Quiz (Optional)
1. What does AR stand for?
2. Name one plant you identified today
3. How often should [plant] be watered?

## Differentiation

### For Struggling Students
- Pair with stronger student
- Provide more teacher assistance
- Use simpler plants (more common ones)
- Allow more time

### For Advanced Students
- Try identifying multiple plants
- Experiment with AR placement layouts
- Discuss why spacing matters
- Connect to science concepts (photosynthesis, water cycle)

## Safety Considerations

1. **Device Safety**:
   - Handle tablets/phones carefully
   - No running while using devices
   - Return devices when done

2. **Privacy**:
   - Explain camera usage
   - No photos of other students without permission
   - Parental consent already obtained

3. **Physical Safety**:
   - Be aware of surroundings when using AR
   - Don't walk into objects while looking at screen

## Extension Activities

### At Home
- Students identify plants at home
- Take growth photos over week
- Share findings in next class

### In School Garden
- Use app in actual school garden
- Connect BLE sensors (if available)
- Track real plant growth

### Art Integration
- Draw identified plants
- Create garden layout designs
- Make plant care posters

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AR not working**:
   - Check if device supports ARCore
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Find flat surface

2. **Plant not recognized**:
   - Try different angle
   - Get closer to plant
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Try different plant

3. **App crashes**:
   - Restart app
   - Restart device if needed
   - Report to teacher

## Teacher Notes

- **Preparation**: Test app on devices before lesson
- **Backup Plan**: Have plant identification cards if tech fails
- **Time Management**: Keep activities moving; don't let students get stuck
- **Engagement**: Encourage exploration and questions

## Resources

- App user guide (for teachers)
- Plant database reference
- AR troubleshooting guide

## Reflection (Post-Lesson)

**Questions for Teacher**:
1. What went well?
2. What challenges did students face?
3. How can the lesson be improved?
4. Which students need additional support?

## Next Steps

- Continue growth tracking over weeks
- Introduce more advanced features (measurement, sensors)
- Connect to science curriculum
- Plan actual garden project using app
